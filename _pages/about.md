My name is Jiaqian (Viola) Fan. I recently obtained a Master of Science in Biostatistics from The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. I am currently working as a Research Assistant in the Department of Sarcoma Medical Oncology at MD Anderson Cancer Center.

In my role, I focus on developing spatial profiles of the tumor microenvironment in Desmoplastic small-round-cell tumor (DSRCT) and identifying neopeptides in Ewing Sarcoma. My work includes investigations into the EWS::WT1 fusion and WT1 knockdown experiments to explore novel molecular targets. With a strong background in bioinformatics and biostatistics, I am proficient in programming languages such as Python, R, and SAS, and have hands-on experience with experimental techniques like Western blotting and immunoassays.

I am passionate about advancing cancer research by integrating computational methods and spatial biology to understand tumor heterogeneity and tumor-stroma interactions.
